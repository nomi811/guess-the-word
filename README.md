# Guess the Word Game
### This is a game I created through a SkillCrush tutorial where you get so many tries to guess the word by typing in letters.

JavaScript, HTML and CSS were used. Although the HTML and CSS were given as part of the tutorial. Only the JavaScript was coded by me.

It calls an API to get an array of words and randomly selects one. You get 8 tries to guess the word.
